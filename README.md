# A Star Algorithm with Visualization

• Visualizing the shortest path between any two points in the presence of a barrier.
• A* algorithm is based on heuristic methods for finding the distance to achieve a complete and optimal path.
• Priority Queue Data structure, A* algorithm and Pygame Library are used in this project.
